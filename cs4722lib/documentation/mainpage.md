This library was developed, and continues to be developed,
to support CS 4722
 (Computer Graphics and Multimedia)
 at Kennesaw State University.
 
The library is intended to serve several purposes.

* Hide code that, once introduced, is almost never changed in any
    significant way.
* Modularize code to help isolate application components.
    * Many of the exercises and examples build on previous examples, so we want to
        be able to focus on the task at hand and ignore the remaining code.
* Provide resources to make life a bit easier
    * Geometric models to use in creating scenes
    * Intuitive representations of transformations 
    * Loading of textures from image files

The projects directory in the course web site will have an archive of the latest source code for the library.
